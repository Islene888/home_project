# Interview Tasks

Welcome to the our take-home project interview! 👋

Please complete the tasks below and submit your solution as a zip file (excluding the node_modules folder to save space).

> ⚠️ **Important Notes:**
>
> 1. You're encouraged to use **AI agents** to help complete these tasks.
> 2. Please keep these interview questions **confidential** and do not share them publicly online.
> 3. Focus only on the tasks listed below. There's no need to add extra features or complete tasks beyond what's required.

## What We're Looking For

- **Product Thinking**: Making smart decisions when requirements aren't crystal clear
- **Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable, and well-structured code
- **AI Usage**: Understanding AI-generated code and making it better, not just settling for "it works"

**Remember:** Quality beats quantity every time. It's much better to nail a few tasks than to rush through everything.

Good luck! You've got this! 🚀

#### Task A1: Add Useful Shapes

Expand the shape options beyond Rectangle and Triangle.

> 💡 **Hint:** Spend some time observing and trying out the existing shapes to understand their styles and behaviors.

#### Task A2: Undo/Redo

Add the ability to undo and redo recent actions.

#### Task A3: Settings Persistence

Currently, when users configure stroke properties (color, width) for a shape and then disable the stroke, those settings are lost when re-enabling stroke. Implement a solution to preserve stroke configurations so users can toggle stroke on/off without losing their customization.

> 💡 **Hint:** Before implementing, think about what the available solutions are and what their pros and cons are.
